    "* Bias is the difference between the actual and predicted values of a model. \n",
    "* Variance is the variation in the predicted values of a model for different data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model with high bias is too simple and underfits the data, meaning it cannot capture the complex patterns in the data. \n",
    "* A model with high variance is too complex and overfits the data, meaning it memorizes the noise and outliers in the data2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal machine learning model has low bias and low variance, meaning it can make accurate and consistent predictions for new data. However, achieving this balance is difficult because there is a trade-off between bias and variance: reducing one usually increases the other. This is called the bias-variance dilemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of techniques to reduce bias are: \n",
    "1. increasing model complexity, \n",
    "2. adding more features, or using more advanced algorithms. \n",
