    "# Anomaly Detection \n",
    "Anomaly detection is a process of finding things that are different from what is expected or normal. Anomalies can be rare or unusual events or observations that do not fit well with the rest of the data. Anomalies can indicate problems or opportunities, such as errors, defects, frauds, diseases or new trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you measure the temperature of a room every hour and you see that it is usually between 20°C and 25°C, but one day it suddenly goes up to 40°C, that would be an anomaly. It could mean that something is wrong with the heating system or that there is a fire in the room. Anomaly detection would help you identify this abnormal situation and take action accordingly."
