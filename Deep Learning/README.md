<p align="center"><img width="40%" src="1_assests/logo.png" /></p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the hands-on materials used in the deep learning course by [PadhAI](https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/).  
The course is now available [here at Guvi](https://www.guvi.in/deep-learning)!

## Repository Structure
Each folder inside the repo contains the code for the respective topic and has support to execute the code directly in Google colab and/or Kaggle Kernels without worrying about installing the dependencies
